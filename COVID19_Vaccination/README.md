This project's goal is to explore global COVID-19 vaccination data and observe trends over time. The cleaned data was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress).

## EDA Summary

### I. What percentage of the vaccinated population is fully vaccinated? 

Pitcairn, Qatar, and Tokelau have the highest percentage (100%), with their entire vaccinated population receiving full vaccination status. This may be the case for smaller countries like Pitcairn and Tokelau as the number of individuals who are vaccinated is already relatively low, therefore, it would require fewer resources (compared to a country with a larger population) and people vaccinated to receive 100% full vaccination status. On the other hand, Nigeria has the lowest % of fully vaccinated population relative to the entire vaccinated population with only ~45%. 

### II. Determining Total Population using % of people fully vaccinated and # of people fully vaccinated.

China and India have the largest total populations whereas Pitcairn and Tokelau have the smallest populations. This corroborates the findings from the first question as the countries with the highest % of fully vaccinated people also have the fewest people altogether. 

### III. Calculating the rolling sum of the % of the U.S. population that is fully vaccinated.

In December of 2020, the first vaccines were distributed in America and we see a low % of the population being fully vaccinated. This checks out as vaccines were in short supply and high demand. By May of 2021, this number jumps up to ~41% and gradually increasing over time.
